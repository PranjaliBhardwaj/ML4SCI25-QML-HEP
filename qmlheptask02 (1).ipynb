model to learn both local and global interactions within the jet. Using graph-based deep learning for quark and gluon jet classification is a well-founded approach, as it aligns naturally with the underlying structure of jet events. Rather than treating jets as images or fixed-dimensional arrays, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a more flexible and expressive way to capture relationships between constituent particles.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) and ParticleNet are both models for graph-based tasks, but they differ in their applications and designs.\n<br>\n**GNN because**: Permutation Invariance; The model remains unaffected by the ordering of particles. GNNs are a general framework for tasks involving graphs, where nodes and edges represent entities and their relationships, respectively. They use a message-passing mechanism to learn node or graph-level representations.\nDynamic Edge Construction; Learns particle relationships beyond fixed spatial structures.\nEfficient Feature Learning; Message-passing mechanisms enhance representation learning.\n<br><br>\n**ParticleNet because**, a state-of-the-art GNN for jet tagging, employs EdgeConv layers to dynamically learn particle interactions, outperforming traditional CNNs in jet classification. ParticleNet, on the other hand, is a specialized GNN for particle physics tasks, such as jet classification and particle tracking. It uses particle-specific features, such as Lorentz invariant quantities, and is tailored to capture interactions between particles in high-energy physics events. While GNNs have broad applications across fields, ParticleNet is specifically built to handle the unique characteristics of particle data.\n<br>\nWe are evaluating two GNN models because : \nA broader understanding of different graph-based approaches.<br>\nA fair assessment of performance trade-offs (accuracy, efficiency, generalization).<br>\nInsights into optimal jet representation for classification.<br>","metadata":{}},{"id":"057235ea-a45c-4485-ac6a-df76921b21b6","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Although there is scope of improvement as we can see its performance, optimisations in model architecture enhancements, data respresentations staregies, hypermeter optimisation,etc.","metadata":{}}]}
