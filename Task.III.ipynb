During this time, I developed an interest in quantum computing and its applications. Subsequently, I began participating in various competitions, such as the Tryst Quantum Quiz organized by IIT Delhi, where I secured a top 15 rank. Additionally, I have been engaged in research, contributing to a paper titled *\"Quantum-Assisted Secure Nano-Network Traffic Framework for Real-Time Medical Data Transmission in Smart Hospitals.\"*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Why Quantum Computing is better than Classical Computing\n**Classical Computing**\n<br>\nClassical computing is based on binary logic, where information is processed using bits that can be either 0 or 1. These bits are manipulated through logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), and computation follows deterministic rules.\n<br>\nFeatures :\n1. Uses bits (0 or 1) as the smallest unit of information.<br>\n2. Works based on classical physics and Boolean algebra. <br>\n3. Performs operations sequentially (or in parallel with multiple cores). <br>\n4. Follows deterministic logic, meaning given the same input, it always produces the same output. <br>\n5. Efficient for most day-to-day applications like word processing, web browsing, and gaming.\n<br>\nLimitations:\n* Struggles with problems requiring exponential time (e.g., factorization, complex simulations).\n* Faces physical limits due to transistor miniaturization.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Quantum Computing**\nQuantum computing uses quantum mechanics to process information using qubits. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in superposition (both 0 and 1 at the same time) and be correlated with each other across distances. These properties allow quantum computers to perform computations in parallel, offering potential speedups for certain types of problems.\n<br>\nFeatures :\n1. Uses qubits instead of classical bits.\n2. Exploits superposition (a qubit can be in multiple states simultaneously).\n3. Utilizes entanglement (two qubits can be correlated, allowing faster information transfer).\n4. Uses quantum interference to amplify correct results and suppress incorrect ones.\n5. Enables exponential speedup for specific tasks (e.g., Shor’s Algorithm for factorization, Grover’s Algorithm for search).\n<br>\nAdvantages:\n* Can solve complex optimization problems faster.\n* Can efficiently simulate quantum systems (useful for materials science and drug discovery).\n* May break classical encryption through Shor’s Algorithm.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have seen applications of quantum computing into various places such as Quantum physics, cryptography, drug developments, financial modeling, etc. and using classical computing these works cannot be done with such great efficency and accuracy. We have furthur solved some task of QML-HEP using quantum mechanics which shows how better we can perform all those activities using quantum computing instead of classical computing. (like in qvit) I have studies quantum mecahnics in my engineering as well as in my school and which is an intresting part for me of physics. Using quantum mechanics many scientists solve many complex equations with some explanable answers. It gives reasons and explanations to complex challenges which makes it fun to learn and understand.

I have heard about them before but never used that much, although I have worked some on tensorflow quantum. I was working on a project for basically quantum clustering, quantum algorithms to find the centroids of clusters and perform the clustering process more efficiently than classical counterparts, especially for high-dimensional data. <br>\nQuatum Algorithm: Although from beginning I was indulge in Blockchain, AI and Cyber seccurity and learn quantum applications in them, quantum threats, quantum encryption, Shor Algorithm that how it can efficently factor large polynomial numbers which could be a threat to current encryption methods.
